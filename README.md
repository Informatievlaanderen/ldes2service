# LDES2Service

LDES2Service is a set of NPM packages you can use to replicate an LDES in a back-end system of choice.

A Linked Data Event Stream (LDES) is a collection of immutable objects. The HTTP interface adheres to the [LDES specification](https://w3id.org/ldes/specification) by SEMIC. An LDES can be fragmented in different ways using the [TREE specification](https://w3id.org/tree/specification). Check the [TREE Linked Data Fragments website](https://tree.linkeddatafragments.org) for more background and implementations.

## Running it with Docker

The LDES Replicator is available as a docker image: `ghcr.io/osoc21/ldes-replicator:helm-chart`

### Requirements

A redis server and a backend server of your choice are needed for the LDES replicator to work,

### Start a LDES Replicator instance

```shell
docker run \
  -e URLS=ldes.example \
  -e STATE_CONFIG={"host":"127.0.0.1", "id":"replicator"} \
  -e CONNECTORS=[0] \
  -e CONNECTOR_0_TYPE=ldes-backend-connector \
  -e CONNECTOR_0_CONFIG={...} \
  ghcr.io/osoc21/ldes-replicator:latest
```

### Environment Variables

- `URLS`: comma-separated list of LDES URLs.
- `STATE_CONFIG`: JSON object with the Redis connection settings.

```js
{
  //Used to separate the state of different replicators in a shared Redis server
  "id": string,
  //The Redis server hostname/IP address and port
  "host": string,
  "port": number,
  //The Redis server password, if needed
  "password": string
}
```

- `POLL_INTERVAL`: The amount of ms the replicator will wait before requesting an update.
- `CONNECTORS`: JSON array containing the IDs of the connectors to use.
- `CONNECTOR_<ID>_TYPE`: Name of the NPM package to use as a backend connector, a list of those can be found below.
- `CONNECTOR_<ID>_CONFIG`: JSON object with the backend connector settings, those will depend on the connector used.

### Connectors

#### @ldes/ldes-postgres-connector

Stores the Linked Data Events inside a postgres DB backend.

```js
CONFIG:
{
  //The name of the table the events will be stored in
  "tableName": string,
  //The Postgres server credentials
  "username": string,
  "password": string,
  "database": string,
  //The Postgres server hostname/IP address and port
  "hostname": string,
  "port": number
  //How many versions of an LDES element should be kept (0 => any amount)
  "amountOfVersions": number
}
```

#### @ldes/ldes-mongodb-connector

Stores the Linked Data Events inside a MongoDB backend.

```js
CONFIG:
{
  //The MongoDB server credentials
  "username": string,
  "password": string,
  "database": string,
  //The MongoDB server hostname/IP address and port
  "hostname": string,
  "port": number
  //How many versions of an LDES element should be kept (0 => any amount)
  "amountOfVersions": number
}
```

### Docker-compose

Docker compose can be used to host the Redis server, LDES Replicator and on the same dedicated server.

```yaml
version: "3"

services:
  postgres: # Backend service...
  redis: # Redis service ...
  replicator:
    build: .
    image: ghcr.io/osoc21/ldes-replicator
    environment:
      URLS: LDES.example/
      STATE_CONFIG: '{
        "id":"replicator",
        "host":"redis"
      }'
      POLL_INTERVAL: '5000'
      CONNECTORS: '[postgres]'
      CONNECTOR_postgres_TYPE: '@ldes/ldes-postgres-connector'
      CONNECTOR_postgres_CONFIG: '{
        "amountOfVersions":0,
        "tableName":"ldes",
        "username":"postgres",
        "password":"postgres",
        "database":"postgres",
        "hostname":"postgres",
        "port":5432
      }'
```

Full example [here](https://github.com/osoc21/ldes2service/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

### Helm

A helm chart is also available but hasn't been published to a Chart repository yet.

To add an LDES replicator to your cluster:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/osoc21/ldes2service.git
cd ldes2service/ldes-replicator-helm
helm install --generate-name .
```

### Helmfile

Helmfile can be used to set the Replicator setting more easily.

```yaml
releases:
  - name: ldes-replicator
    chart: ./ldes2service/ldes-replicator-helm
    values:
      - replicator:
          urls:
            - 'LDES.example'
            - 'LDES2.example'
          state:
            id: 'replicator'
            host: 'redis-master'
          polling_interval: 5000
        connectors:
          PG:
            type: '@ldes/ldes-postgres-connector'
            settings:
              amountOfVersions: 0
              tableName: 'ldes'
              username: 'postgres'
              password: 'postgres'
              database: 'postgres'
              hostname: 'postgresql'
              port: 5432
```
